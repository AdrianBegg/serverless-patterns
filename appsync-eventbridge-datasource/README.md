# Appsync to EventBridge Datasource 

This pattern demonstrates sending events directly to Event Bus by integrating Appsync with Eventbridge Datasource.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements

- [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
- [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions

1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
   ```
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
   ```bash
   cd serverless-patterns/appsync-eventbridge-datasource/cdk
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. From the command line, configure AWS CDK:
   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION # e.g.
   cdk bootstrap 1111111111/us-east-1
   cdk bootstrap --profile test 1111111111/us-east-1
   ```
5. From the command line, use AWS CDK to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the `lib/cdk-stack.ts` file:
   ```bash
   npm run build && cdk deploy
   ```

## How it works

Let's submit mutation request through AWS Appsync Console. Appsync valiate the schema and publish the message directly to Event Bus using the Appsync JS Resolver.

## Delete stack

```bash
cdk destroy
```
