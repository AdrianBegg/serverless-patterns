      "This sample project demonstrates how to use Amazon Event Bridge and AWS Lambda to respond to CloudTrail events.  In this example, the <code>AdvertiseByoipCidr</code> triggers a Lambda function to run and validate whether or not the address space is expected to be advertised by checking for the address space in a list of allowed CIDRs in a DynamoDB Table.",
      "If the address space is not permitted to be advertised, the Lambda will publish a message to a SNS Topic to notify an administrator that an unexpected CIDR was advertised and will automatically remove the advertisement of the CIDR.",
      "This pattern deploys an EventBridge Rule, a Lambda Function, a DynamoDB Table and a SNS Topic."
