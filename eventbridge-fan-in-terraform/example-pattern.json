      "The Eventbuses to aggregate can be defined in terraform.tfvars file (Sample ARNs is provided, replace with Eventbus ARNs as needed).",
      "The provider.tf file also lists the AWS regions of the fan-in Eventbus and central Eventbus (replace these based on where your Eventbuses exist and where you want your central bus to be created)."
