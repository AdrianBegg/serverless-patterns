      "This project aims to build an integration between API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Bedrock, leveraging Python and the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for infrastructure as code. The core functionality revolves around exposing an API endpoint via API Gateway that accepts a user-defined prompt.",
      "When a prompt is received, the API Gateway triggers an AWS Lambda function. This Lambda function is responsible for invoking a machine learning model (anthropic.claude-v2 for now, but can be extended to include others) hosted on Amazon Bedrock. To ensure compatibility with Bedrock, a Lambda Layer is utilized that contains the latest version of the Boto3 library, as only the most recent Boto3 version includes a client for Amazon Bedrock.",
      "The Lambda function uses this Boto3 client to interact with Amazon Bedrock, sending the user prompt to the model with default parameters (which can be modified in the code) and receiving the model's output. The result is then sent back to the client through the API Gateway."
